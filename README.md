Software Discussion
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
This project was a game created to be an app on an Android device. The customer wanted to expand into other platforms which included a comparison with a final recommendation on my part. 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
To document thoroughly, I included all of my customers’ possible options. I talked all about operating systems and platforms. This included cost, effectiveness of each, and how these decisions may or may not impact the future of the business. 
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Understanding what this project was going to be used for helped a lot. Some projects work best on the cloud while others do not. Some projects rely more on security. Still, other projects simply want a cost effective product. Every outcome will be different and also change over time. Starting with the diagram, I was able to eventually figure out what this customer needed over time. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably go back into my code and simplify it. How can I make these ten lines turn into a simple two lines, for example. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? This user was a candidate for the cloud but simply did not realize it yet. After going over the pros with the customer they came to the realization, as well. We ended up increasing their speed and memory while decreasing their overall cost.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached this project creatively. I made sure at the beginning that the client understood every option available to them. I wanted them to make the right decision specifically for their business. Not everyone is the same, and in this case that proved to be the case. In the future I honestly would not speed up my process – I think the customer received a thorough product.
